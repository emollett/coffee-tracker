This is for tracking the coffee purchasing of my team. Coffee is input with info about who bought it, when it was opened, and if people particularly liked it. In future I might do something with the date opened data, but for now it just tracks who bought the packs.

To run this you will also need https://github.com/emollett/coffee-tracker-backend
