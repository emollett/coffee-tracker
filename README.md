# coffee-tracker

This is for tracking the coffee purchasing of my team. Coffee is input with info about who bought it, when it was opened, and if people particularly liked it. In future I might do something with the date opened data, but for now it just tracks who bought the packs.

I used a couple of sources to help me create this, this post gave me the basic structure for the app, and helped me get it storing and retrieving the data. I ended up pulling it apart into different components, but it was a very handy starting point.<br>
